<!-- Product Filter and Search

#Overview
This project is a lightweight frontend demo showcasing how to build a product listing interface with client‑side filtering and search functionality using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.Users can search by name and filter by categories via toggle buttons.


#Features
-Dynamic Rendering: Products are loaded from a JavaScript data array and rendered as cards.
-Live Search: Text input allows real-time filtering by product name.
-Category Filters: Clickable buttons enable multi-select filtering (e.g. “Salmon”, “Shrimp”, etc.) 
Google for Developers.
-Responsive Design: Uses CSS Grid and media queries to adjust layout across screen sizes.
-Error Handling: Handles missing images gracefully with fallback styles.


#Technical Stack
-HTML5 for markup structure.
-CSS3 for layout, styling, and responsive behavior.
-JavaScript for:
   -Data modeling (products.data array)
   -DOM manipulation (creating cards, attaching event listeners)
   -State management (tracking active filters)
   -Filtering logic based on search text and selected categories 


#Installation
-Clone or download the repository.
-Place index.html, styles.css, script.js, and asset files (/images, /icons) together.
-Open index.html in a browser to view the project.


#Usage
-Use the search box to filter products by name instantly.
-Click on category buttons to filter products by category; multiple filters can be      activated.
-Deselect a category to reset that filter; when no filters are active, all products are shown.

#Future Enhancements
-Implement pagination for long product lists.
-Add sorting options (price, popularity, etc.).
-Introduce CSS transitions for smooth card appearance/exit.
-Fetch product data dynamically from an external API or JSON file.
-Enhance accessibility with ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
